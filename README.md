# Repo for using nvim and fish terminal as main drivers

- assumes using fish, wsl2, ubuntu
- run scripts inside /install to install tools (at own risk, of course)

## Setup

run once to create soft-links of configuration files where your tools expect them to be:
~/nvim/start.sh

## TODO
[ ] sessions history
[ ] download latest curl (for json flag)
[ ] surround plugin for vim
[ ] what's the debugging story?
[ ] Port cmd d
[ ] mirage
[ ] proselint
